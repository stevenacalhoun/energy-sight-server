## Overview ##
This is just going to be a simple Rails server to serve all the data we collect to our [front end visualization](https://github.com/stevenacalhoun/music-thermometer-vis). I'm hoping to host this for free on a service called Heroku. I've worked with it a bit in the past and it's good for quick and dirty Rails servers. This server will basically have two functions:

1. Store all the data we have collected
2. Serve the data in JSON format when the vis requests it

Might be a small pain to setup on each of your machines so I'm not going to type out all the instructions. We can just look at it later in person.
